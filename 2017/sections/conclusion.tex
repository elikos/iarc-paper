\section*{Conclusion}

Elikos’ fourth attempt at mission 7a of the IARC will be made with a much refined solution composed for the first time of all the required puzzle pieces. A consolidated detection module, an enhanced and configurable decision maker module, a fully integrated and adapted obstacle avoidance system, a custom and more reliable localization module, a brand new target tracking module, and a larger, more appropriate interaction landing gear for robots interaction have been united. With the combination of those, we are confident in our vehicle’s ability to interact with ground robots, avoid obstacles, and navigate autonomously in the competition’s environment.
